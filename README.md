# blender_ezdxf_exporter
Replacement to standard Blender DXF exporter relying on ezdxf third-party module

To be able to run the add-on, you need to first install the ezdxf module into the local Blender Python environment.

You need to be connected to the Internet when activating the add-on, since it relies on downloading a third Party module (ezdxf).
If there is an error, try again by launching Blender in Administrator mode
